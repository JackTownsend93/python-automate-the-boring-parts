Chapter 5 Practice Questions:

1).     What does the code for an empty dictionary look like?
            emptyDict = {}    (i.e., curly braces define a dict)
2).     What does the dictionary value with a key 'foo' and value 42 look like?
            fooDict = {'foo': 42}
3).     What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list?
            Dictionaries are unordered.
4).     What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] is spam is {'bar': 100}?
            No key of 'foo', thus key error.
5).     If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'car' in spam and 'car' in spam.keys()?
            Nothing (in checks for existance of a key value)
6).     If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?
            'cat' in spam will return whether 'cat' exists at a key, 'cat' in spam.values() will return the keys for which the value is 'cat'.
7).     What is a shortcut for the following code?
        if 'color' not in spam:
            spam['color'] = 'black'
        
            Use the setDefault method:
            spam.setDefault('color', 'black')
8).     What module and function can be used to "pretty print" dictionary values?
            pprint.pprint()
