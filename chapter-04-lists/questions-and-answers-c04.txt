Chapter 4 Practice Questions:

1).     What is []?
            The opening and closing of a list.
2).     How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam?
            spam[2] = 'hello'
For spam = ['a','b','c','d']...
3).     What does spam[int(int('3'*2)//11)] evaluate to?
            '3'*2 == '33', int('32')//11 == 3, spam[3] == 'd'
4).     What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
            Final value in list, i.e., 'd'.
5).     What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
            A list slice of the first two indices, i.e., ['a','b'].
For bacon = [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]...
6).     What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
            The first index in which 'cat' appears, i.e., 1.
7). What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
            Appends 99, i.e., [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]
8). What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
            Removes the first instance of 'cat', i.e., [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]
9). What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
            + and * respectively.
10). What is the difference between append() and insert() list methods?
            append() adds to the end of a list, insert() specifies and index at which to add.
11). What are the two ways to remove values from a list?
            del() and remove()
12). Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values:
            Strings are an array of characters, lists are an array of variables. Both can be concatenated, replicated.
13). What is the difference between lists and tuples.
            List are mutable, tuples are not.
14). How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer 42 in it?
            (42)
15). How do you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
            tuple() and list(), respectively.
16). Variables that "contain" list values don't actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?
            References to the list.
17). What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
            copy.copy() makes a copy of a mutable value like a list or dictionary (rather than just copying the reference, as copy() would do). deepcopy() copies lists that contain lists.
